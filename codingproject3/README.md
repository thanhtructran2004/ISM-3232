 Next.js Button Counter

A simple and reusable **Button Counter** built with **React** and **Next.js (App Router)**.  
This project demonstrates component-based design, React state management, and accessibility best practices using `aria-live` and semantic HTML elements.

 Project Overview

This app renders two `Counter` components:
- One with default settings (`initialCount = 0`, `initialStep = 1`)
- One with custom props (`initialCount = 5`, `initialStep = 2`)

Each counter includes:
- Buttons to **increment**, **decrement**, and **reset** the count.
- A numeric **step input** that allows the user to change how much to add/subtract per click.
